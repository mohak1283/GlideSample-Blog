<h3 id='introduction'>Introduction</h3>
<br>
In this blog I'm going to show you how to work with Glide library in Android.
<br><br><br>


<h3 id='what-is-glide'>What is a Glide?</h3>
<br>
Glide is an Image Loader Library for Android and is recommended by Google itself. It is developed by bumptech. It provides animated GIF support and handles image loading/caching.
By default, each image loaded with Glide is cached in the Memory or Disk.
Before Glide, developers would have to write a TON of boilerplate code to display images, process images, download images and cache images. But, with Glide, all these things are possible with just few lines of code.
Also, it is open source therefore you can always check out its code <a href="https://github.com/bumptech/glide" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
<br><br><br>


<h3 id='featuresofglide'>Features of Glide</h3>
<br>
Glide offers some great features which are discussed in this section
<ul>
<li><b>Easily set images to ImageViews</b><br><br>
You can set images from internet url's, drawables, and many other sources. Glide is very flexible.
</li>
<br><br>
<li><b>Animated GIF Decoding</b><br><br>
Glide supports loading of animated gifs and you can decode them as Bitmap to load it as a still image 
or you can load it as a gif.
</li>
<br><br>
<li><b>Thumbnail support</b><br><br>
Glide supports the feature of thumbnail. This feature basically loads the blurred image into the view as 
a thumbnail so that user don't need to see the loading indicator, and when the original image is ready to be displayed, it display it in a view. 
</li>
<br><br>
<li><b>Lifecycle integration</b><br><br>
Requestes made with Glide are lifecycle aware which means that requests are paused 
in onPause() method to avoid battery drainage and started in onStart() method.
</li>
<br><br>
<li><b>Caching</b><br><br>
Glide supports caching while loading the image. By default, when image is loaded, it is cached in 
the memory and disk so that when user tries to load the same image, then it is loaded from the memory
instead of again fetching it from the url. 
</li>
<br><br>
<li><b>Transformations</b><br><br>
Glide supports some built in transformations like circleCrop, fitCenter, centerCrop, etc.
</li>
<br><br>
</ul>
Enough of theory, now Let's begin the coding!!!
<br><br><br>


<h3 id='GlideApp'>Glide Sample App</h3>
<br>
Now, Let's dive into the code. We will build the Simple App which contains some 
images showing different features available in Glide.
<br><br>
<img class="img-fluid text-center" src = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/media/blog/22/demo.png" >
<br><br>

Let's begin the coding!!!
<br><br><br>


<h3 id='dependencies'>Dependencies</h3>
<br>
Open build.gradle (Module:app) and add the following Glide dependency.
<br><br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mohak1283/36be49c9a8fd373e0f79072b229afe57.js"></script>
<br>
Make sure you have the latest version of dependencies. You can check the latest version <a href="https://github.com/bumptech/glide" target = "_blank" rel = "nofollow">here</a>
<br><br><br>


<h3 id='ActivityLayout'>Designing MainActivity Layout</h3>
<br>
Add the following code in your activity_main.xml file. 
This layout contains combination of LinearLayouts to display the image in either vertical
orientation or in horizontal orientation<br><br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mohak1283/e2fc6561571804df7d702a4ae94694cd.js"></script>
<br><br><br>


<h3 id='normalImage'>Displaying Normal Image</h3>
<br>
In this section, we will simply display the image from the url without customizing it.<br><br>
<ul>
<li>
First, Declare the ImageView object inside the MainActivity class and find the reference of that image
in the onCreate() method using findViewById() method.<br><br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mohak1283/fa30ae8fcca035a5847b7ac6f6dd5e95.js"></script>
</li>
<li>
<p> Now, Load the image from the url and display it in the first ImageView. </p>
<p> In the below code, we are just calling the load() method of Glide library and passing the url of the image as a parameter to it and 
Finally we are setting that image into the first ImageView using into() method inside the OnCreate() method. </p>
<br><br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mohak1283/0731722fd9323321fc84507fc2f8d016.js"></script>
</li>
</ul>
Current state of the app : <br>
<div class="row  justify-content-center">
  <div class=" col-md-4 col-md-offset-4">
    <img class="img-fluid text-center" src = "C:\Users\Manik\Desktop\glide images\normal Image.png">
  </div>
</div>
<br><br><br>


<h3 id='croppedImage'>Displaying Cropped Image</h3>
<br>
In this section, we will display an Image with some cropping transformation. We will apply 
centerCropping and circleCropping to the Image. Before you start, 
you need to first understand what RequestOptions in Glide are. <br><br>
<b>RequestOptions : </b> RequestOptions is basically a class defined in Glide library which provides several
methods to customize the image you are fetching from the url.
<br><br> 
<ul>
<li><b>Center Cropped Image : </b>
<br><br>
This part we'll be focussing on displaying the image with center cropped transformation. 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>
First, Declare the ImageView object inside the MainActivity class and find the reference of that image
in the onCreate() method using findViewById() method.<br><br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mohak1283/76622cd229550b1d3c69894591b57bf6.js"></script>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, Load the image from the url and display it in the second ImageView. </p>
<p>In the below code, we 
are calling the load() method of Glide and passing the url of the image as a parameter to it 
and we are applying the RequestOptions directly in a RequestBuilder without the generated API and calling centerCrop() method, which basically 
scales the image such that both the x and y dimensions are greater than or equal to the view
and centers the image in a view. </p>
<br><br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mohak1283/b82b49db2c075046f40aba8df9ac10fb.js"></script>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
Current state of the app : <br>
<div class="row  justify-content-center">
  <div class=" col-md-4 col-md-offset-4">
    <img class="img-fluid text-center" src = "C:\Users\Manik\Desktop\glide images\center cropped image.png">
  </div>
</div>
<br><br>

<li><b>Circle Cropped Image : </b>
<br><br>
This part we'll be focussing on displaying the image with cirlce cropped transformation. 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>
First, Declare the ImageView object inside the MainActivity class and find the reference of that image
in the onCreate() method using findViewById() method.<br><br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mohak1283/3f714dc11515f9ed7ea580dd965f7a5c.js"></script>
</li>
<li>
Now, Load the image from the url and display it in the third ImageView. In the below code, we 
are calling the load() method and calling circleCrop() method, which basically 
crops the image and transforms it into a cirlce.
<br><br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mohak1283/a095954bb522f6bd5ea46092aef73735.js"></script>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
Current state of the app : <br>
<div class="row  justify-content-center">
  <div class=" col-md-4 col-md-offset-4">
    <img class="img-fluid text-center" src = "C:\Users\Manik\Desktop\glide images\circle cropped image.png">
  </div>
</div>
</ul>
<br><br><br>

<h3 id='lowResImage'>Displaying Low Resolution Image</h3>
<br>
In this section, we will display the low resolution image using override() method.<br><br>
<ul>
<li>
First, Declare the ImageView object inside the MainActivity class and find the reference of that image
in the onCreate() method using findViewById() method.<br><br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mohak1283/9274174929618dd404026079141f1b5b.js"></script>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, Load the image from the url and display it in the fourth ImageView. </p>
<p>In the below code, we 
are loading the image using load() method. After that,
we are calling override() method which takes two parameters - width & height. In this case, we are 
passing 50 as width and 50 as height which results in displaying the low resolution image
Finally we are setting that image into the fourth ImageView. </p>
<br><br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mohak1283/2b08d0dd53594b0e84e50eb69285d4d7.js"></script>
</li>
</ul>
Current state of the app : <br>
<div class="row  justify-content-center">
  <div class=" col-md-4 col-md-offset-4">
    <img class="img-fluid text-center" src = "C:\Users\Manik\Desktop\glide images\low res image.png">
  </div>
</div>
<br><br><br>

<h3 id='errorImage'>Displaying Error Image</h3>
<br>
In this section, we will display the error image using error() method. This method gets called 
when there occurs some error fetching the original image from the url.<br><br>
<ul>
<li>
First, Declare the ImageView object inside the MainActivity class and find the reference of that image
in the onCreate() method using findViewById() method.<br><br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mohak1283/d80c4cd15361451498d809b732acba75.js"></script>
</li>
<li>
<p> Now, Load the image from the url and display it in the fifth ImageView. </p>
<p> In the below code, we 
are loading the image using load() method. After that,
we are calling error() method and passing the reference of errorImage which I have downloaded 
in the drawable folder as its parameter. You can download the error image from <a href="https://github.com/mohak1283/GlideSample/blob/master/app/src/main/res/drawable/errorimage.png" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
</p>
<p>Finally set the image in the ImageView. 
This section of code means that first Glide will try to fetch the image from the given url and 
if it encounters some error fetching the image, then it will load the errorImage. </p>
<br><br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mohak1283/3bbd6888c8f7e7f4cdc4bfb9a5dd3d5c.js"></script>
</li>
</ul>
Current state of the app : <br><br>
First image indicates that when the internet connection is off, then the error image is displayed, then
after that turn on the internet and now the image will be loaded from the internet as shown in Figure 2
and after that again turn off the internet, now, you will notice that still image is displaying
in the imageview because previously when image is loaded it is cached in the memory or disk therefore in 
this case, image is loaded from cache as shown in Figure 3.<br><br>

     </div>
</div>
<br><br><br>


<h3 id='cachedImage'>Displaying Image & disabling cache</h3>
<br>
In this section, we will display an Image from the url and we will disable the caching option here.
As metioned in the Introduction section, that each image loaded with Glide is cached in the memory or disk
by default, therefore, we will see how to disable this option here. 
<ul>
<li><b>Normal Image : </b>
<br><br>
In this part, we will fetch a simple image and disable caching option.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>
First, Declare the ImageView object inside the MainActivity class and find the reference of that image
in the onCreate() method using findViewById() method.<br><br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mohak1283/7350be6ac28c2338bfca246938349159.js"></script>
</li>
<li>
Now, Load the image from the url and display it in the ImageView. In the below code, we 
are calling the load() method and passing the url of the image as a parameter to it 
and calling two methods here : <br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>skipMemoryCache() : </b> 
<br><br>
This method takes a boolean parameter indicating that whether to skip the memory cache or not. 
In this case, we are passing <b>false</b> as its parameter which means that image will not be cached in the memory.
Everytime, it will fetch the image from the url.<br><br>
</li>
<li><b>diskCacheStrategy() : </b> 
<br><br>
This method is used to tell whether the image should be saved in disk cache or not.
In this case, we are passing <b>DiskCacheStrategy.NONE</b> as its parameter which means that image will not be cached in the disk.
Everytime, it will fetch the image from the url.
</li>
<br><br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mohak1283/207e70c4a585783bd9a1685952b7dc43.js"></script>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
Current state of the app : <br><br>
First image indicates that when the internet connection is off, then the error image is displayed, then
after that, turn on the internet and now the image will be loaded from the internet as shown in Figure 2
and after that, again turn off the internet, now, you will notice now the image will not
be displayed in the imageView because we are disabling the cache option here, therefore, everytime
the image is fetched from the url.<br><br>

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
     <div style="flex-column flex:1;padding-right:5px;">
          <p class="text-center">Network OFF</p>
          <img class="img-fluid text-center" src = "C:\Users\Manik\Desktop\glide images\not cached image1.png" "height="400" width="200">
     </div>
     <div style="flex-column flex:1;padding-left:5px;">
           <p class="text-center">Network ON</p>
          <img class="img-fluid text-center" src = "C:\Users\Manik\Desktop\glide images\not cached image2.png" "height="400" width="200">
     </div>
	  <div style="flex-column flex:1;padding-left:5px;">
          <p class="text-center">Network ON</p>
          <img class="img-fluid text-center" src = "C:\Users\Manik\Desktop\glide images\not cached image3.png" "height="400" width="200">
     </div>
</div>
<br><br>
</ul>
<br><br><br>

<h3 id='RequestListener'>Request Listener</h3>
<br>
In this section, we will fetch a simple image and disable caching option and also we will listen to the 
image request so that when image is loaded or when it is failed, 
then we will perform some action. 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>
First, Declare the ImageView object inside the MainActivity class and find the reference of that image
in the onCreate() method using findViewById() method.<br><br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mohak1283/7ad80181cc5b48c7e0d45b9ac554a0cb.js"></script>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, Load the image from the url and display it in the third ImageView. </p>
<p>In the below code, we 
are calling the load() method and 
calling skipMemoryCache() and diskCacheStrategy() methods to disable the caching of this 
image and another method we are calling here is <b>placeholder()</b> method, which basically indicates
that when the image is loading, during that process, it will show the image which is passed 
as its parameter. Finally, we are calling <b>listener()</b> method, and initializing the RequestListener()
which results in overriding of two methods : </p>
<ul>
<li><b>onLoadFailed() : </b> 
<br><br>
This method is called when the image loading has failed due to some reasons like no internet connection, etc.
In this method, we are setting the visibility of the progressBar to INVISIBLE so that it just
vanished off from the screen, when image loading is failed.<br><br>
</li>
<li><b>onResourceReady() : </b> 
<br><br>
This method is called when the image loading is successfull.
In this method, we are setting the visibility of the progressBar to INVISIBLE so that it just
vanished off from the screen, when image is successfully loaded.
</li>
</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mohak1283/8d2cc9262e642f3fe3d037d618c49d38.js"></script>
Current state of the app : <br><br>
First image indicates that when the image is loading from the internet, during that process, placeholder
iamge and progressBar is being displayed and Figure 2 shows that when the image is loaded from 
the internet then it is displayed in the imageview and progressBar and placeholder image vanishes
off from the screen. 
<br><br>
<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
     <div style="flex-column flex:1;padding-right:5px;">
          <p class="text-center">Loading Image</p>
          <img class="img-fluid text-center" src = "C:\Users\Manik\Desktop\glide images\last image1.png" "height="400" width="200">
     </div>
     <div style="flex-column flex:1;padding-left:5px;">
           <p class="text-center">Image Loaded</p>
          <img class="img-fluid text-center" src = "C:\Users\Manik\Desktop\glide images\last image2.png" "height="400" width="200">
     </div>
</div>
<br><br><br>

 

That's All! Happy Coding!
